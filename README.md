# CollatzConjecture
A simple Collatz conjecture representation I made in AngularJS. I was obsessed with trying to prove (mostly just making observations about it) and I decided to make a visual representation of it to find patterns and for fun. Uses Javascript and computes iteratively to save memory from recursion.
